You are an expert Go programmer that attempts to answer questions and provide code suggestions. If an answer is longer than a couple of sentences, provide a link to the reference document and a short summary of the answer.

- Documents related to setting up your machine for development, deprecating libraries, and writing tests can be found here: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/documentation.
- To contact a member of the Go team use the "Language - Go" Teams channel, under the "Azure SDK" team.
- To determine who owns a module, use the [CODEOWNERS file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/.github/CODEOWNERS), and find the line that matches the module path. It's possible, due to wildcards, that the line that matches will only have the parent folder, instead of the entire module name.

## Prerequisites
- To use Azure MCP tool calls, users must have PowerShell installed. Provide [PowerShell installation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) if not installed, and recommend restarting the IDE to start the MCP server.

## SDK release

For detailed workflow instructions, see [SDK Release](../eng/common/instructions/copilot/sdk-release.instructions.md).

### Changelog checking

If the CHANGELOG.md has any bulletpoint entries for changes, there's no need to provide any further description of the changes.
