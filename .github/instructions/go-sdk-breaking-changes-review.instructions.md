# Go SDK Breaking Changes Review

Follow these steps to help users review the Go SDK breaking changes. Show the high-level description to users to help them understand the flow. Use the provided tools to perform actions and gather information as needed.

## Overview

1. **Generate Go SDK locally** - Reproduce the breaking changes locally by generating the Go SDK from the API specification.
2. **Gather review info** - Gather enough info before starting the review.
3. **Review breaking changes** - Categorize each breaking change and find correlated change of API specification.
4. **Resolve breaking changes** - Use client customization to address the breaking changes.
5. **Gather results** - Gather results and provide report to user.

## Step 1: Generate the SDK Locally

Follow [Generate Go SDK from API specification](./go-sdk-generation.instructions.md) to generate the SDK from the API specification.

**Prerequisites**: Ensure the SDK generation completed successfully with breaking changes detected.

## Step 2: Gather Review Information

### Extract Generation Result

**Goal**: Identify the type of SDK generation and extract breaking change information.

**Actions**:

1. Read `generateOutput.json` file from the workspace root folder.
2. Extract the following information:
   - Package path (`<package-path>`)
   - Changelog content (`<changelog-content>`)
   - Breaking change items (`<breaking-change-items>`)

**Error Handling**: If `generateOutput.json` is missing or corrupted, regenerate the SDK first.

**Success Criteria**: Successfully extract `<package-path>`, `<changelog-content>`, and `<breaking-change-items>`.

### Determine SDK Generation Type

**Goal**: Determine the type of SDK generation based on the changed files.

**Actions**:

1. Run `git diff` command to analyze changes under `<package-path>` in current workspace.
2. Determine the generation type based on the following criteria:
   - **"TypeSpec Migration"**: If diff contains removal of `autorest.md` file
   - **"TypeSpec Update"**: If diff contains any changes to `*.tsp` files
   - **"Update Swagger"**: All other cases

**Success Criteria**: Determine `<sdk-generation-type>` from the three possible values.

### Get Specification Diffs

**Goal**: Retrieve the specification diffs from the PR for correlation analysis.

**Actions**:

1. Use GitHub CLI to fetch the PR diff: `gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER> > sdk-diff.txt`
2. Save the diff to `sdk-diff.txt` in the root folder of current workspace.

**Error Handling**: If GitHub CLI fails or PR is not available, skip this step and note the limitation in the final report.

**Success Criteria**: `sdk-diff.txt` contains the specification diffs, or step is skipped with documented reason.

## Step 3: Review Breaking Changes

### Categorize Breaking Changes

**Goal**: Each breaking change item should be categorized by its type and impact.

**Actions**:

1. For each item in `<breaking-change-items>`:
   - Follow the [Azure Go SDK Breaking Changes Review and Resolution Guide](../../documentation/sdk-breaking-changes-guide.md)
   - Use the section corresponding to `<sdk-generation-type>`
   - Categorize the breaking change by type (e.g., API removal, parameter changes, type changes)
   - Determine the root cause and impact
   - Identify potential resolution approaches

**Success Criteria**: All breaking change items are categorized with type, reason, and potential resolution.

### Specification Correlation

**Goal**: Find correlated specification changes for each breaking change.

**Actions**:

1. If `sdk-diff.txt` exists and contains valid diffs:
   - Analyze the specification changes in the diff
   - Correlate each breaking change with specific specification modifications
   - Document the relationship between spec changes and SDK breaking changes

2. If `sdk-diff.txt` is unavailable or empty:
   - Skip this step and note the limitation
   - Proceed with breaking change analysis based on SDK changes only

**Success Criteria**: Breaking changes are correlated with specification changes where possible, or limitations are documented.

## Step 4: Resolve Breaking Changes

**Goal**: Resolve the breaking changes using client customization if applicable.

**Actions**:

1. Ask the user: "Would you like to resolve the breaking changes using client customization?"

2. If the user responds **"No"**:
   - Skip to Step 5 (Gather Review Result)
   - Include note in final report that resolution was not requested

3. If the user responds **"Yes"**:
   - Check if `client.tsp` exists in the local specification folder
   - **If `client.tsp` exists**:
     - Review existing customizations
     - Propose modifications to resolve breaking changes
     - Show specific code changes needed
   - **If `client.tsp` does not exist**:
     - Create a new `client.tsp` file
     - Add customizations to resolve breaking changes
     - Provide the complete file content

**Error Handling**: If customization cannot resolve specific breaking changes, document the limitation and suggest alternative approaches.

**Success Criteria**: Breaking changes are resolved through customization where possible, or limitations are documented.

## Step 5: Gather Review Result

**Goal**: Provide comprehensive breaking changes analysis report.

**Actions**:

Generate the result in the following format:

#### Breaking Changes Summary

```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Breaking Changes Detected**: [count of <breaking-change-items>] changes found
üì¶ **Affected Package**: [<package-path>]
üîß **SDK Generation Type**: [<sdk-generation-type>]
```

#### Individual Analysis

For each breaking change item:

```
üö® **Breaking Change**: [change-description]
üìù **Category**: [breaking-change-category]
üìã **Reason**: [breaking-root-cause]
üîç **Related Spec Change**: [specification-change] | "Not available" if correlation step was skipped
üîß **Resolution**: [resolution-method] | "Not attempted" if resolution was skipped
üí° **Impact**: [impact-assessment]
```

#### Overall Assessment

```
‚úÖ **Resolvable**: [count] breaking changes can be resolved through customization
‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires Attention**: [count] breaking changes need manual intervention
üìã **Next Steps**: [recommended-actions]
```

**Success Criteria**: Complete analysis report is generated with all available information and clear next steps.
