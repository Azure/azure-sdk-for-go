azure-sdk-for-go provides Go packages for managing and using Azure services. It has been
tested with Go 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10.

To be notified about updates and changes, subscribe to the [Azure update
feed](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/).

Users of the SDK may prefer to jump right in to our samples repo at
[github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-sdk-for-go-samples][samples_repo].

### Build Details

Most packages in the SDK are generated from [Azure API specs][azure_rest_specs]
using [Azure/autorest.go][] and [Azure/autorest][]. These generated packages
depend on the HTTP client implemented at [Azure/go-autorest][].

[azure_rest_specs]: https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs
[Azure/autorest]: https://github.com/Azure/autorest
[Azure/autorest.go]: https://github.com/Azure/autorest.go
[Azure/go-autorest]: https://github.com/Azure/go-autorest

The SDK codebase adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) and thus
avoids breaking changes other than at major (x.0.0) releases. However,
occasionally Azure API fixes require breaking updates within an individual
package; these exceptions are noted in release changelogs.

To more reliably manage dependencies like the Azure SDK in your applications we
recommend [golang/dep](https://github.com/golang/dep).

# Install and Use:

### Install

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/...
```

or if you use dep, within your repo run:

```sh
$ dep ensure -add github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go
```

If you need to install Go, follow [the official instructions](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Use

For complete examples of many scenarios see [Azure-Samples/azure-sdk-for-go-samples][samples_repo].

1. Import a package from the [services][services_dir] directory.
1. Create and authenticate a client with a `New*Client` func, e.g.
   `c := compute.NewVirtualMachinesClient(...)`.
1. Invoke API methods using the client, e.g. `c.CreateOrUpdate(...)`.
1. Handle responses.

[services_dir]: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/master/services

For example, to create a new virtual network (substitute your own values for
strings in angle brackets):

Note: For more on `OAuthTokenProvider` and authentication see [the next
  section](#authentication).

```go
import (
	"github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/network/mgmt/2017-09-01/network"
	"github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest"
	"github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/to"
)

vnetClient := network.NewVirtualNetworksClient("<subscriptionID>")
vnetClient.Authorizer = autorest.NewBearerAuthorizer("<OAuthTokenProvider>")

vnetClient.CreateOrUpdate(
  "<resourceGroupName>",
  "<vnetName>",
  network.VirtualNetwork{
    Location: to.StringPtr("<azureRegion>"),
    VirtualNetworkPropertiesFormat: &network.VirtualNetworkPropertiesFormat{
      AddressSpace: &network.AddressSpace{
        AddressPrefixes: &[]string{"10.0.0.0/8"},
      },
      Subnets: &[]network.Subnet{
        {
          Name: to.StringPtr("<subnet1Name>"),
          SubnetPropertiesFormat: &network.SubnetPropertiesFormat{
            AddressPrefix: to.StringPtr("10.0.0.0/16"),
          },
        },
        {
          Name: to.StringPtr("<subnet2Name>"),
          SubnetPropertiesFormat: &network.SubnetPropertiesFormat{
            AddressPrefix: to.StringPtr("10.1.0.0/16"),
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  nil)
```

### Authentication

Most SDK operations require an OAuth token for authentication and authorization.
You can get one from Azure Active Directory using the SDK's
[authentication](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/adal) package
and an existing service principal (aka Client ID and secret) as shown in the
following example.

The `OAuthTokenProvider` returned by this sample should be set as the
authorizer for the resource client, as shown in the [previous section](#use).

Note: To create a new service principal, run
`az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "<app_name>"` in the
[azure-cli](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli). See
[these docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
for more info. Copy the new principal's ID, secret, and tenant ID for use in
your app.


```go
import (
	"github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/adal"
	"github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/azure"
)

var (
	clientID =        "<service_principal_ID>"
	clientSecret =    "<service_principal_secret>"
	tenantID =        "<tenant_ID>"
	subscriptionID =  "<subscription_ID>"
)

func getServicePrincipalToken() (adal.OAuthTokenProvider, error) {
	config, err := adal.NewOAuthConfig(azure.PublicCloud.ActiveDirectoryEndpoint, tenantID)
	return adal.NewServicePrincipalToken(
		*oauthConfig,
		clientID,
		clientSecret,
		azure.PublicCloud.ResourceManagerEndpoint)
}
```

# Versioning

azure-sdk-for-go provides at least a basic Go binding for every Azure API. To
provide maximum flexibility to users, the SDK even includes previous versions of
Azure APIs which are still in use. This enables us to support users of the
most updated Azure datacenters, regional datacenters with earlier APIs, and
even on-premises installations of Azure Stack.

**SDK versions** apply globally and are tracked by git
[tags](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tags). These are in x.y.z form
and generally adhere to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) specifications.

**Service API versions** are generally represented by a date string and are
tracked by offering separate packages for each version. For example, to choose the
latest API versions for Compute and Network, use the following imports:

```go
import (
    "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/compute/mgmt/2017-12-01/compute"
    "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/network/mgmt/2017-09-01/network"
)
```

Occasionally service-side changes require major changes to existing versions.
These cases are noted in the changelog.

All avilable services and versions are listed under the `services/` path in
this repo and in [GoDoc][services_godoc].  Run `find ./services -type d
-mindepth 3` to list all available service packages.

[services_godoc]:       https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services

### Profiles

Azure **API profiles** specify subsets of Azure APIs and versions. Profiles can provide:

* **stability** for your application by locking to specific API versions; and/or
* **compatibility** for your application with Azure Stack and regional Azure datacenters.

In the Go SDK, profiles are available under the `profiles/` path and their
component API versions are aliases to the true service package under
`services/`. You can use them as follows:

```go
import "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/profiles/2017-03-09/compute/mgmt/compute"
import "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/profiles/2017-03-09/network/mgmt/network"
import "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/profiles/2017-03-09/storage/mgmt/storage"
```

The 2017-03-09 profile is the only one currently available and is for use in
hybrid Azure and Azure Stack environments. More profiles are under development.

In addition to versioned profiles, we also provide two special profiles
`latest` and `preview`. These *always* include the most recent respective stable or
preview API versions for each service, even when updating them to do so causes
breaking changes. That is, these do *not* adhere to semantic versioning rules.

The `latest` and `preview` profiles can help you stay up to date with API
updates as you build applications. Since they are by definition not stable,
however, they **should not** be used in production apps. Instead, choose the
latest specific API version (or an older one if necessary) from the `services/`
path.

As an example, to automatically use the most recent Compute APIs, use one of
the following imports:

```go
import "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/profiles/latest/compute/mgmt/compute"
import "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/profiles/preview/compute/mgmt/compute"
```
