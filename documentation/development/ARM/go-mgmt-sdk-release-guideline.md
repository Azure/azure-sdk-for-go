## Prerequisites

### 1. GitHub Account
- Link to Microsoft/Azure organization: [Link GitHub Account](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_wiki/wikis/internal.wiki/111/Linking-Your-GitHub-Account)
- Optionally, update your GitHub profile with your Microsoft email and real name.

### 2. Permissions
- **SDK Repo**: Request SDK permissions [here](https://coreidentity.microsoft.com/manage/Entitlement/entitlement/azuresdkpart-heqj).
- **Asset Repo**: For vendors, join the Azure SDK team via [this link](https://github.com/orgs/Azure/teams/azure-sdk-write-vendors).
- **Azure Subscription**: Vendors must request access to the TME subscription or ask MSFT employees to add them.

### 3. Repositories to Clone
- [azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs)
- [azure-sdk-for-go](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go)

### 4. Install Necessary Tools
- **Generator Tool**: Run `go get github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tools/generator`. If this fails, run `cd eng/tools/generator && go install` (Reference [link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/blob/72fe46870cff900262d54be73aa9a1eccfde12f2/documentation/code-generation.md#L46)).
- **Test Proxy**: Install by following [this guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools/blob/main/tools/test-proxy/Azure.Sdk.Tools.TestProxy/README.md#installation).
- **TSP Client**: Run `npm install -g @azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-cli` (Ensure Node v20.18.0 is installed).

## Release Process

### 1. Release Request
- Release requests are initiated by the service team and should be submitted monthly.
- A request is created as an issue at: [Release Request Issues](https://github.com/Azure/sdk-release-request/issues).
- To process the request, use the following query: 
`is:issue state:open label:Go -label:HoldOn created:2024-09-27..2024-10-15`

### 2. General Release Guidelines
- All requests should be completed before the 4th Friday of the month.
- The issue may be labeled "ReadyForApiTest," or the live test about the service is ok indicating readiness.It appears in specs repo PR,[like](Azure/azure-rest-api-specs#33035)
- Ensure the "API Availability Check" passes for all services before releasing.

### 3. Update Existing RP

#### Steps:
1. If the issue lacks the `PRready` label, manually create a PR.
 - If the issue has the `Inconsistent` tag, update the version tag in `autorest.md`.
 - If the issue has the `TypeSpec` label, generate the SDK code using `generator release-v2`:
   ```
   generator release-v2 <path-to-sdk> <path-to-specs> <RP-name> <package-name> <tspconfig.yaml>
   ```
 - If no `TypeSpec` label, update the commit ID and tag in `autorest.md` and then:
   ```
   generator release-v2 <path-to-sdk> <path-to-specs> --update-spec-version=false
   ```
2. After generating the code, fix any issues, and if live tests are included:
 - Run `test-proxy restore` to restore assets.
 - Update API version in test records and push changes.

3. Commit changes and create a PR.
 - Handle PR errors (e.g., broken links) by commenting `/check-enforcer override`.
 - Wait for approval and automatic merging in Pipelines.

4. After pipeline completion, approve the merge and close the corresponding issue.

### 4. Releases New Service
#### Steps for New Service:
1. Pull the latest changes from:
 - [azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs)
 - [azure-sdk-for-go](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go)
 
2. Create a folder structure under `azure-sdk-for-go/sdks/resourcemanager` that matches the spec repo.
 - Copy the template from [aztemplate](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/template/aztemplate).

3. Run the generator and ensure the service name is correct in `README.md`.

4. Update the pipeline configuration in `ci.yml` and add `UsePipelineProxy: false` if you add live test.

5. Handle PR errors and ensure the pipeline runs as expected.
 - For new projects with minimal CI checks, use `/azp run prepare-pipelines`.

## Special Case in PR

### Handling Multiple Versions:
- Release services in ascending order of versions (e.g., FirstGA before FirstBeta).
- For services with multiple versions, the generated code will not change; only `changelog.md` should be updated.

### Different Swagger and Go Package Names:
- If the Swagger name differs from the Go package name, use the following command for code generation:
`generator release-v2 <sdk-path> <specs-path> resources <package-name>`

---

## Add Live Test and Record
It is not a required step in release process, we can ensure whether the api version has been deployed by live test.
### Install Scripts:
1. Run the following PowerShell commands to download necessary scripts:
 ```ps
 Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile "generate-assets-json.ps1" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools/main/eng/common/testproxy/onboarding/generate-assets-json.ps1
 Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile "common-asset-functions.ps1" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools/main/eng/common/testproxy/onboarding/common-asset-functions.ps1
```
2. Run the script in the service path:
`.\generate-assets-json.ps1 -InitialPush`
This will create a config file and push recordings to the Azure SDK Assets repo.
3. Before testing, create a utils_test.go file as the entry point for live tests. Modify "package" and pathToPackage to match your service.
4. Set the test mode to "live" using:
`$ENV:AZURE_RECORD_MODE="live"`
5. Once tests pass, switch to "playback" mode and ensure all tests pass in both modes.
6. Push the final assets with test-proxy push --assets-json-path assets.json.

## Breaking Change Review

### Steps:
1. Check for breaking changes by reviewing the Issues under sdk-release-request with both "Breaking Change" and "Stable" labels.
1. If thereâ€™s an associated PR, check for approval in the comments.
1. If no PR exists, locate the readme.md for the corresponding service and check the commit history for breaking changes.
