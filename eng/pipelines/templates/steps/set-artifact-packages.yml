  # Package-Properties folder contains the package properties for all discovered packages that were either A) affected by the PR or
  # B) explicitly present in the service directory. This repo splits the builds into two categories: "resourcemanager" and "dataplane". While
  # a given directory may contain both, there will be a separate build definition to release the management packages. Due to this
  # we need to artificially filter the packages to ensure that only the packages targeted for THAT ci.yml are built.
  # When we merge the PR adding go - pullrequest, this code will also merge, meaning the public - <service> - ci builds will still operate
  # EXACTLY the same as they did before the pipelinev3 change. This is important to ensure that we don't accidentally build the wrong packages
  # while in the integration period. After we disable all the public `go - <service> - ci` builds, only the `go - pullrequest` build WONT provide
  # an artifact list, which will allow the expand/contract. Meanwhile the internal builds will continue to provide the artifact list from their
  # individual ci.yml and ci.resourcemanager.yml files.
