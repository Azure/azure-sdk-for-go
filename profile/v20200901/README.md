# Azure Profile Module for Go

Azure Profiles offer a means of virtualizing the API Versions of services that should be targeted by an application or SDK.
This concept was introduced for [Azure Stack](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/azure-stack), where the environment in
which applications will be executed is less consistent than when targeting the public cloud.
This module is for profile `hybrid-2020-09-01`.
