### Breaking Changes

- FunctionDefinition.Parameters has been changed to take JSON instead of an object/map. You can set it using code
  similar to this:

  ```go
    parametersJSON, err := json.Marshal(map[string]any{
      "required": []string{"location"},
      "type":     "object",
      "properties": map[string]any{
        "location": map[string]any{
          "type":        "string",
          "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA",
        },
      },
    })

    if err != nil {
      // TODO: Update the following line with your application specific error handling logic
      log.Printf("ERROR: %s", err)
      return
    }

    // and then, in ChatCompletionsOptions
    opts := azopenai.ChatCompletionsOptions{
      Functions: []azopenai.FunctionDefinition{
        {
          Name:        to.Ptr("get_current_weather"),
          Description: to.Ptr("Get the current weather in a given location"),
          Parameters: parametersJSON,
        },
      },
    }
  ```
