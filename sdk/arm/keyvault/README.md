[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/master/sdk/arm/keyvault/2019-09-01/armkeyvault)

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

- an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- Go 1.13 or above

## Install the module

This project uses [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for versioning and dependency management.

Install the Azure Keyvault module:

```sh
go get github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/arm/keyvault/2019-09-01/armkeyvault
```

## Authorization

When creating a client, you will need to provide a credential for authenticating with Azure Keyvault.  The `azidentity` module provides facilities for various ways of authenticating with Azure including client/secret, certificate, managed identity, and more.

```go
cred, err := azidentity.NewDefaultAzureCredential(nil)
```

For more information on authentication, please see the documentation for `azidentity` at [pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity).

## Connecting to Azure Keyvault

Once you have a credential, create a connection to the desired ARM endpoint.  The `armcore` module provides facilities for connecting with ARM endpoints including public and sovereign clouds as well as Azure Stack.

```go
con := armcore.NewDefaultConnection(cred, nil)
```

For more information on ARM connections, please see the documentation for `armcore` at [pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/armcore](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/armcore).

## Clients

Azure Keyvault modules consist of one or more clients.  A client groups a set of related APIs, providing access to its functionality within the specified subscription.  Create one or more clients to access the APIs you require using your `armcore.Connection`.

```go
client := armkeyvault.NewVaultsClient(con, "<subscription ID>")
```
