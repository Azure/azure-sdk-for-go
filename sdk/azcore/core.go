// The Policy interface represents a mutable Policy object created by a Factory. The object can mutate/process
// the HTTP request and then forward it on to the next Policy object in the linked-list. The returned
// Response goes backward through the linked-list for additional processing.
// NOTE: Request is passed by value so changes do not change the caller's version of
// the request. However, Request has some fields that reference mutable objects (not strings).
// These references are copied; a deep copy is not performed. Specifically, this means that
// you should avoid modifying the objects referred to by these fields: URL, Header, Body,
// GetBody, TransferEncoding, Form, MultipartForm, Trailer, TLS, Cancel, and Response.

// Pipeline represents a linked-list of policies and pipeline options that apply to all policies in the pipeline.
// You construct a Pipeline by calling the pipeline.NewPipeline function. To send an HTTP request, call pipeline.NewRequest
// and then call Pipeline's Do method passing a context, the request, and a method-specific Factory (or nil). Passing a
// method-specific Factory allows this one call to Do to inject a Policy into the linked-list. The policy is injected where
// the MethodFactoryMarker (see the pipeline.MethodFactoryMarker function) is in the slice of Factory objects.
//
// When Do is called, the Pipeline object asks each Factory object to construct its Policy object and adds each Policy to a linked-list.
// THen, Do sends the Context and Request through all the Policy objects. The final Policy object sends the request over the network
// (via the HTTPSender object passed to NewPipeline) and the response is returned backwards through all the Policy objects.
// Since Pipeline and Factory objects are goroutine-safe, you typically create 1 Pipeline object and reuse it to make many HTTP requests.
