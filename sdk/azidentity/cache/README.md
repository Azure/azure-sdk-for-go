# Azure Identity Cache Module for Go

This module implements a cross-platform persistent token cache for [azidentity](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity) credentials. See that module's [examples](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity#pkg-examples) for sample code showing how to configure persistent caching for a credential, and its [token caching document](https://aka.ms/azsdk/go/identity/caching) for more information about the implementation.
