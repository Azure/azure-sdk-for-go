# Azure Container Registry client module for Go

Azure Container Registry allows you to store and manage container images and artifacts in a private registry for all types of container deployments.

Use the client library for Azure Container Registry to:

- List images or artifacts in a registry
- Obtain metadata for images and artifacts, repositories and tags
- Set read/write/delete properties on registry items
- Delete images and artifacts, repositories and tags
- Upload and download images

## Getting started

### Install packages

Install `azcontainerregistry` and `azidentity` with `go get`:
```Bash
go get github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/containers/azcontainerregistry
go get github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity
```
[azidentity](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity) is used for Azure Active Directory authentication as demonstrated below.

### Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- A supported Go version (the Azure SDK supports the two most recent Go releases)
- A [Container Registry service instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro)

To create a new Container Registry, you can use the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal),
[Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-powershell), or the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-azure-cli).
Here's an example using the Azure CLI:

```Powershell
az acr create --name MyContainerRegistry --resource-group MyResourceGroup --location westus --sku Basic
```
### Authentication

This document demonstrates using [azidentity.NewDefaultAzureCredential](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity#NewDefaultAzureCredential) to authenticate.
This credential type works in both local development and production environments.
We recommend using a [managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) in production.

[Client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/containers/azcontainerregistry#Client) and [BlobClient](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/containers/azcontainerregistry#BlobClient) accepts any [azidentity][https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity] credential.
See the [azidentity](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity) documentation for more information about other credential types.

#### Create a client

Constructing the client requires your Container Registry's endpoint URL, which you can get from the Azure CLI (`loginServer` value returned by `az acr list`) or the Azure Portal (`Login server` value on registry overview page).

```go
import (
	"github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity"
	"github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/containers/azcontainerregistry"
	"log"
)

func main() {
	cred, err := azidentity.NewDefaultAzureCredential(nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to obtain a credential: %v", err)
	}

	client, err := azcontainerregistry.NewClient("<your Container Registry's endpoint URL>", cred, nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to create client: %v", err)
	}
}
```

## Key concepts

A **registry** stores Docker images and [OCI Artifacts](https://opencontainers.org/).
An image or artifact consists of a **manifest** and **layers**.
An image's manifest describes the layers that make up the image, and is uniquely identified by its **digest**.
An image can also be "tagged" to give it a human-readable alias.
An image or artifact can have zero or more **tags** associated with it, and each tag uniquely identifies the image.
A collection of images that share the same name but have different tags, is referred to as a **repository**.
