# Release History

## 0.4.0 (2023-11-27)

### Features Added

- New functionality for Event Grid namespaces: 
  - Client.PublishCloudEvent can be used to publish a single `messaging.CloudEvent`.
  - Client.RenewCloudEventLocks can extend the lock time for a set of events.
  - Client.ReleaseCloudEvents (via ReleaseCloudEventsOptions.ReleaseDelayInSeconds) can release an event with a 
    server-side delay, allowing the message to remain unavailable for a configured period of time.

### Breaking Changes

- FailedLockToken, included in the response for settlement functions, has an `Error` field, which contains the data previously
  in `ErrorDescription` and `ErrorCode`.
- Settlement functions (AcknowledgeCloudEvents, ReleaseCloudEvents, RejectCloudEvents) take lock tokens as a parameter.
