# Azure Monitor Ingestion client library for Go

The Azure Monitor Ingestion client library is used to send custom logs to [Azure Monitor][azure_monitor_overview] using the [Logs Ingestion API][ingestion_overview].

This library allows you to send data from virtually any source to supported built-in tables or to custom tables that you create in Log Analytics workspace. You can even extend the schema of built-in tables with custom columns.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- 
- An [Azure subscription][azure_subscription]
- An [Azure Log Analytics workspace][azure_monitor_create_using_portal]
- A [Data Collection Endpoint][data_collection_endpoint]
- A [Data Collection Rule][data_collection_rule]

### Install the package

### Create the client

## Key concepts

### Data Collection Endpoint

Data Collection Endpoints (DCEs) allow you to uniquely configure ingestion settings for Azure Monitor. [This article][data_collection_endpoint] provides an overview of data collection endpoints including their contents and structure and how you can create and work with them.

### Data Collection Rule

Data collection rules (DCR) define data collected by Azure Monitor and specify how and where that data should be sent or stored. The REST API call must specify a DCR to use. A single DCE can support multiple DCRs, so you can specify a different DCR for different sources and target tables.

The DCR must understand the structure of the input data and the structure of the target table. If the two don't match, it can use a transformation to convert the source data to match the target table. You may also use the transform to filter source data and perform any other calculations or conversions.

For more details, see [Data collection rules in Azure Monitor][data_collection_rule]. For information on how to retrieve a DCR ID, see [this tutorial][data_collection_rule_tutorial].

### Log Analytics workspace tables

Custom logs can send data to any custom table that you create and to certain built-in tables in your Log Analytics workspace. The target table must exist before you can send data to it. The following built-in tables are currently supported:

- [CommonSecurityLog](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/commonsecuritylog)
- [SecurityEvents](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/securityevent)
- [Syslog](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/syslog)
- [WindowsEvents](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/windowsevent)

### Logs retrieval

The logs that were uploaded using this library can be queried using the [Azure Monitor Query][azure_monitor_query] client library.
