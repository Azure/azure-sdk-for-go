## 0.1.0 (2021-10-08)
- To better align with the Azure SDK guidelines (https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html), we have decided to change the module path to "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/resourcemanager/eventgrid/armeventgrid". Therefore, we are deprecating the old module path (which is "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/eventgrid/armeventgrid") to avoid confusion.
