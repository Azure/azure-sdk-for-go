# Release History

## 0.1.1 (2021-10-14)
- fix wrong module path in go.mod

## 0.1.0 (2021-10-08)
- To better align with the Azure SDK guidelines (https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html), we have decided to change the module path to "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/resourcemanager/sql/armsql". Therefore, we are deprecating the old module path (which is "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/sql/armsql") to avoid confusion.
