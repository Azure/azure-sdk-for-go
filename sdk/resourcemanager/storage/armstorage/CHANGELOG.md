# Release History

## 0.1.0 (2021-09-29)
- To better align with the Azure SDK guidelines (https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html), we have decided to change the module path to "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/resourcemanager/storage/armstorage". Therefore, we are deprecating the old module path (which is "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/storage/armstorage") to avoid confusion.
