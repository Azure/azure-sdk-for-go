	// Topic in contrast to queues, in which each message is processed by a single consumer, topics and subscriptions
	// provide a one-to-many form of communication, in a publish/subscribe pattern. Useful for scaling to very large
	// numbers of recipients, each published message is made available to each subscription registered with the topic.
	// Messages are sent to a topic and delivered to one or more associated subscriptions, depending on filter rules
	// that can be set on a per-subscription basis. The subscriptions can use additional filters to restrict the
	// messages that they want to receive. Messages are sent to a topic in the same way they are sent to a queue,
	// but messages are not received from the topic directly. Instead, they are received from subscriptions. A topic
	// subscription resembles a virtual queue that receives copies of the messages that are sent to the topic.
	// Messages are received from a subscription identically to the way they are received from a queue.
